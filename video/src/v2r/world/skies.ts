//   S1_EVENING  S1's golden evening (the owner, v2 G4: "why is it blue sky and then suddenly abruptly orange, weird ...
//               a beautiful way to do a gentle gradient"): the caption field's mint flat through the band (y 317-556),
//               a gentle zenith, a pale warm light band, the peach horizon at y 800 behind the far roofs, the low sun's
//               warmth 340 x 153 around SUN0, low and wide (the disc stays the set's flat SunDisc, drawn on top; no halo
//               with it).
//
// Wired (L1, V2S1_sky.tsx): <Sky spec={S1_EVENING} /> where the six flat S1_SKY steps were (inside the flood's clip),
// no 1.6x halo, and the far city's haze from horizonColor(S1_EVENING, SUN0.x) (the air of
// lib/depth's makeAtmosphere: the sky's lowest colour, warmed under the sun). skyProblems(S1_EVENING, {ink: CM.ink})
// is [] (band dL* 0, ink 11.3:1, the yellow-green crossing at C* 5.9 on the ramp, 6.2 in the sun's warmth). The master
// render keeps its dither: scripts/render-media.mjs --master (CRAFT §g); the check on S1's OPEN sky (3.0 s):
// scripts/qa/check_banding.py --region 0,560,250,712 (the west gap), 400,0,1080,170 (the zenith), 0,270,1080,560 (the
// band); 0,0,330,712 holds the pale cloud strip and the far tower, which read as steps.
